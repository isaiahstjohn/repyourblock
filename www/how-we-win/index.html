                <p>How are we going to achieve our vision?</p>
                <p><strong>First</strong>, we need to understand political power and how to build it at a local level.
                    Watch this video to learn more about “how to work the political machine.”</p>

                <p><strong>Second</strong>, we need to understand the Franklin County Democratic Party apparatus.
                    Here’s a brief overview:</p>
                <p>Every four years, primary voters elect 152 people all across the county to serve as a “ward”
                    representative on the Franklin County Democratic Party Central Committee.</p>
                <p>The Central Committee makes decisions for the party. Their primary function is to
                    determine which candidates are on the “sample ballot.”</p>
                <p>A much smaller group makes initial decisions about which candidates run and which candidates
                    receive support from the party machine. The Central Committee is intentionally kept a secret,
                    so a small group of people can maintain power and control.</p>
                <p><strong>Finally</strong>, we need to work our asses off to recruit new leaders all across the county
                    who
                    share our values and goals.</p>
                <p>The next Central Committee election is March 17, 2020. We need people all across the county
                    to #RepYourBlock and run for Central Committee.</p>
                <p>We can build a new coalition and change the direction of the party when we elect a majority
                    of Central Committee members (a minimum of 80 seats) in March of 2020.</p>
                <p>Do you want to #RepYourBlock and run for Central Committee? If so,
